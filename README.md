# Todo List using React 
# Functionality:
- Added Task: Users should be able to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
- View Tasks: Display all added tasks in a list format.
- Delete Task: Each task should have a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
- Added the capability to mark tasks as completed without deleting them. This could involve toggling the task's state and styling.
- Implemented persistent storage (e.g., saving tasks to local storage) so that tasks are not lost on page reload.
